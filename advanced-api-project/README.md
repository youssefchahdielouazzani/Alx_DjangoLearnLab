# Advanced API Project – Django REST Framework

## Overview
This project is part of the ALX Backend Specialization.  
In this task, we build custom views and generic views using Django REST Framework to handle CRUD operations on a `Book` model.

The main objectives are:
- Implement generic class-based views (List, Retrieve, Create, Update, Delete)
- Configure URL routing
- Add permissions (read-only for public, write for authenticated users)
- Test API endpoints with curl or Postman
- Provide documentation
